Richard Flanagan develops a compelling and incredibly graphic narrative of the horrors experienced by WW2 prisoners of war. He focusses heavily on the themes of love and suffering, and I love his frequent use of the phrase *"The world just is."* Occasionally suffers from telling rather than showing but a must-read. Incredibly valuable for those, like me, disheartened by the lacking quality of supposedly classic Australian literature.
