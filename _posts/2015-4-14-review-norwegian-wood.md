This novel is truly something else. Gripping, emotional and dark, it takes a rather grim view of the human experience, with all its flaws. *Norwegian Wood* deals with the theme of mental illness and highlights how difficult it is to recover. This particularly hit home, with *NW* exploring the pitfalls of loving two people, one mentally healthy and one who is not. A beautiful read, I was struggling not to cry on the train at the end.
