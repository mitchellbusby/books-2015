Reading a teen romance novel straight after a literary novel is never a good experience. Having said that, this was a surprisingly powerful and emotionally charged read, given the initially shaky beginning, literature-wise. Although it tends to lapse into some poorer narrative-telling at times, *Before I Die* gripped me and made me want to cry intensely toward the end. Unfortunately I was in a car with family so I was not afforded such a luxury. Definitely worth a read if you like to feel as emotionally drained as a dried-up autumn leaf.
