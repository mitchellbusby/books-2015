My second read was far more enjoyable than the first; this book fascinates, intrigues and fills your mind with its immersive world. JASPER FFORDE'S main premise has been covered previously but not so spectacularly or with such a modern touch. Note that his eagerness to tell the story led to the plot of *Jane Eyre* being ruined for me, which was somewhat disappointing. Having said that it was unavoidable given the chosen plot progression and thus still read very well.
