This one was a bit of a trek; I have always found Fitzgerald to be difficult to read. Maybe it's cultural references to the time period which I do not possess an understanding of, or the way he structures the narrative. I believe it's due to his aim of achieving a certain aestheticism in literature, which can be a powerful and beautiful thing. However it tends to drag the pace of a read down. Fascinating and tragically beautiful story, however, about a love afflicted by mental illness.
