I really liked this one. Whilst it could probably fall into the category of "good bad books", for lack of any overarching humanist themes, *The Martian* really gripped me with it's level of attention to detail. The enormous amount of research that has gone into this book shows, and adds a credible dimension of realism. I won't really go into it much more since there's a movie out and pretty much everyone knows about it, but this was a good'un.
