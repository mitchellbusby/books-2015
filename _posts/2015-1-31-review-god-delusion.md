The God Delusion is a dense and sophisticated novel. That is not to say I was entirely convinced of the argument presented herein, and at times Dawkins seemed to be on an anti-Christian tirade, which I guess is fair enough (see: Christians harrassing him). Having said that, as an atheist, my position of "no religion is god religion" was definitely enhanced and further developed towards the end of the book, where Dawkins lapses into emotional prose and departs from a purely scientific view. Stick with it and you'll be rewarded.
