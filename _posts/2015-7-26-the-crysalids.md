The Chrysalids, like many good books, is set in a post-apocalyptic future in a pastoral village. The main theme of the novel surrounds the belief that all humans must abide by the "true image" as set out by a holy book - an allusion to the modern-day bible. Alienation also features, and moral ambiguity plays a cameo for an interesting twist of the knife toward the end of the book. Although aimed at a younger audience, this is well worth a read for skeptics of institutions that insist on conformity.
